          <p className="aboutme-paragraphs">I previously worked in corporate finance for a period of 5 years, before deciding to take a career break and going on an adventure around the world. Exploring all the beaches, reefs and mountains I could.</p>
          <p className="aboutme-paragraphs">Then along came the pandemic, everybody&apos;s lives changed and the world stopped. This offered something very unique to me. It offered the chance to stop, reset and try something new.</p>
          <p className="aboutme-paragraphs">Having always had a natural interest in web development, I finally had the perfect opportunity to test the waters. It started with Codecademy, teaching myself HTML, CSS and some JavaScript, and it then led me to enrolling on a 12 week bootcamp with General Assembly.</p>
          <p className="aboutme-paragraphs">Now that I have graduated from the Software Engineering course, I am looking to build on my new skills, grow as a developer and establish myself in an exciting new industry.</p>
