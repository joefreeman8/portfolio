        <h5>A recent graduate of a Software Engineering Immersive by General Assembly.</h5>

          I previously worked in corporate finance for a period of 5 years, before deciding to take a career break and taking an adventure around the world. catching that travel bug of course and exploring all the beaches, reefs and mountains I could.
          <br />
          Then everybody&apos;s lives changed, the world stopped, and I returned to the UK. The pandemic had arrived and it offered something very unique to me. It offered the chance to stop, reset and  reassess.
          <br />
          Having always had a natural interest in web development, I finally had the perfect opportunity. It started with Codecademy, teaching myself HTML, CSS and some JavaScript, and it then led me to enrolling on a 12 week bootcamp with General Assembly.
          <br />
          Now that I have graduated from the Software Engineering course, I am looking to build on my new skills, grow as a developer and establish myself in an exciting new industry.
